  abstract  = {Cross-validation is a fundamental technique for evaluating machine learning models, but its application to co-occurrence network inference algorithms presents unique challenges. This work presents a comprehensive framework for applying cross-validation methods to assess the performance of algorithms that infer associations between biological entities from co-occurrence data.}
