Paper on "Cross-Validation for Training and Testing Co-occurrence Network Inference Algorithms" to the BMC Bioinformatics Journal has been accepted and published online. You can read it [here](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-025-06083-7).
This work is a significant step forward in the field of co-occurrence network inference, providing a robust framework for evaluating algorithm performance through cross-validation techniques. The paper discusses the methodology in detail and presents results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. I am grateful to my co-authors and everyone who contributed to this research. Your support has been invaluable in bringing this work to fruition.
