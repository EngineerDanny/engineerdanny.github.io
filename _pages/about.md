I am a Ph.D. student in the [School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems](https://nau.edu/school-of-informatics-computing-and-cyber-systems/) at Northern Arizona University, with an international research profile spanning multiple continents.

I am the recipient of **prestigious international research funding** totaling over $30,000, including the Quebec government's PBEEE Research Mobility Scholarship ($12,000 CAD) and the European Union's DATAIA International Mobility Grant (€13,500). These awards have enabled **international research collaborations** with leading institutions.

In **Spring 2025**, I will be conducting research as a Statistical Learning Researcher at **INRAE/Université Paris-Saclay** in France, focusing on Poisson Log-Normal (PLN) model benchmarking for microbial data analysis.

I have presented my research at prestigious institutions including the **University of California, Berkeley** (2024), **Arizona State University ML Day** (2023), and the **University of Arizona** (2023), demonstrating the international impact of my work.

My research interests focus on developing fast, accurate, and interpretable algorithms for large-scale biological data analysis, particularly in **microbiome network inference** and **statistical modeling**. I leverage High-Performance Computing to address computational challenges, utilizing NAU's Monsoon cluster to run thousands of parallel jobs for hyperparameter optimization.

My **published research in BMC Bioinformatics** presents a novel cross-validation framework for evaluating co-occurrence network inference algorithms. I am currently extending this work through international collaborations to develop ML models for predicting bacterial associations and exploring **Poisson Log-Normal statistical frameworks** for microbiome data analysis.

My work bridges **statistical theory with practical applications** in genomics and medicine, contributing to our understanding of microbial communities and their interactions in biological systems.
