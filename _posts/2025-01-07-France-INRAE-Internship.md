As we begin 2025, I'm thrilled to share some exciting news about the next chapter in my research journey. **This April, I'll be heading to Paris, France** for a four-month research internship at [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/) (National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment) in collaboration with [Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/).

## üéØ Research Focus: Poisson Log-Normal Models

My research at INRAE will focus on **comprehensive benchmarking of Poisson Log-Normal (PLN) models**, a cutting-edge statistical framework for analyzing microbial data. This work represents a natural extension of my [published research](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-025-06083-7) on cross-validation methods for network inference algorithms.

### What are PLN Models?

Poisson Log-Normal models provide a sophisticated framework for analyzing **count data with complex correlation structures** - exactly the kind of data we encounter in microbiome research. These models excel at:

- **Principal Component Analysis** for high-dimensional biological data
- **Abundance prediction** in microbial communities  
- **Network inference** for understanding species interactions

### The Research Challenge

While PLN models show great theoretical promise, there's been limited systematic comparison of their performance against traditional approaches. My internship will address this gap by:

1. **Benchmarking PLN models** across three key applications
2. **Running large-scale cross-validation experiments** to quantify performance gains
3. **Demonstrating practical advantages** over generalized linear models for microbial count prediction

## üí∞ Prestigious International Funding

This opportunity has been made possible through an extraordinary combination of **international research awards** totaling over ‚Ç¨25,000:

### üá®üá¶ PBEEE Research Mobility Scholarship ($12,000 CAD)
The [Quebec government's prestigious scholarship](https://frq.gouv.qc.ca/en/program/pbeee-international-internships-program/) for short-term international research collaborations. This highly competitive award supports research exchanges between institutions in different countries.

### üá™üá∫ International Mobility Grant (‚Ç¨13,500)  
Awarded by the [DATAIA Institute](https://dataia.eu/), this grant is specifically designed to support research collaboration and student exchange between institutions in different countries.

### üá´üá∑ INRAE Junior Scientific Mobility Program (‚Ç¨2,300)
The [INRAE Hadamard initiative](https://www.inrae.fr/) designed to foster scientific exchange and collaboration among researchers.

## üåç Building International Research Networks

This internship represents more than just a research project - it's about **building lasting international collaborations** that will shape the future of computational biology research. 

### Key Collaborators

I'll be working with leading researchers in statistical modeling and computational biology:

- **Dr. Julien Chiquet** - Expert in statistical learning for biological networks
- **Dr. Mahendra Mariadassou** - Specialist in microbiome data analysis  
- **Dr. St√©phane Robin** - Pioneer in statistical models for biological data

Their collective expertise in PLN models, combined with my background in cross-validation and high-performance computing, creates an ideal environment for groundbreaking research.

### Bridging Continents

This collaboration creates a **unique tri-continental research network**:

- üá∫üá∏ **North America**: High-performance computing expertise (NAU's Monsoon cluster)
- üá´üá∑ **Europe**: Advanced statistical modeling frameworks (INRAE's PLN expertise)  
- üá®üá¶ **Quebec Network**: Methodological validation through government-supported collaboration

## üî¨ Expected Impact

The outcomes of this internship will have broad implications for:

### Academic Research
- **Methodological advances** in statistical modeling for biological data
- **Open-source software** contributions to the R/Python ecosystem
- **Joint publications** bridging American and European research communities

### Practical Applications  
- **Improved microbiome analysis** for medical diagnosis
- **Better understanding** of microbial community dynamics
- **Enhanced predictive models** for ecological and health applications

## üìà Looking Forward

The four months in Paris will be intense and productive, but I'm most excited about the **long-term collaborations** this will establish. International research partnerships are crucial for tackling the complex challenges in computational biology and statistical modeling.

### What's Next?

Over the coming months, I'll be:

1. **Finalizing research protocols** and computational approaches
2. **Preparing for the cultural transition** - brushing up on my French! üá´üá∑
3. **Setting up remote access** to NAU's computing resources for seamless collaboration
4. **Planning knowledge transfer** activities to share insights with both institutions

## üí≠ Reflections on International Research

This opportunity reinforces my belief that the **most impactful research happens at the intersection** of different expertise, cultures, and approaches. The combination of American innovation in high-performance computing with European sophistication in statistical theory promises to yield insights neither approach could achieve alone.

As I prepare for this journey, I'm grateful for the **support from multiple funding agencies** that recognize the value of international collaboration in advancing scientific knowledge.

**Stay tuned** for updates from Paris! I'll be sharing insights about the research process, cultural experiences, and hopefully some exciting preliminary results as they develop.
